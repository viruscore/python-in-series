    "Starting with the tests for time execution of the scripts, you can't see the benefit of using Generators, even _list.append(...)_ implementation gave less execution time. In reality, Generators are considered to runs fast in comparison with _list.append(...)_ method usage, but not in every case. Moving forward to the gifs, showing memory usage, there we see graphics and numbers that differs based on the implementation techniques used. As you can see from the version with _list.append(..)_ method, memory got a lot of load and pressure in comparison with Generators. The yield keeps returning the next result until exhausted and only consumes enough memory to hold the generator and a single result at any moment in time - the implementation with _list_ consumes enough memory to hold all of the results at once. When you get to really large files or data sets that can make the difference between something that runs regardless of the size and something that crashes. So yield is slightly more expensive, per operation, but much more reliable and often faster in cases where you deal with large files or don't exhaust the results. In our case, Generators not only saves a memory load and pressure, moreover runs faster. "
